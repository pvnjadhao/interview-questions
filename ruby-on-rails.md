### What is an active Record? 

Rails Active Record is the Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) layer provided by Rails. It follows the standard ORM model, like 

Tables map to classes, 

Rows map to objects and 

Columns map to object attributes. 

Rails Active Records provide an interface and binding between the tables in a relational database and the Ruby program code that manipulates database records. Ruby method names are automatically generated from the field names of database tables. 

Each Active Record object has CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) methods for database access. This strategy allows simple designs and straight forward mappings between database tables and application objects.
